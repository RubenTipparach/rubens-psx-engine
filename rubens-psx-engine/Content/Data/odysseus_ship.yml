# Odysseus Ship Finale Animation Configuration
# Controls the appearance and movement of the Odysseus ship during the finale sequence

# Ship model scale (default: 2.0)
scale: 2.0

# Ship rotation in degrees [yaw, pitch, roll]
# yaw: rotation around Y axis (left/right)
# pitch: rotation around X axis (up/down)
# roll: rotation around Z axis (barrel roll)
rotation: [0, 0, 0]

# Duration of ship approach animation in seconds
approach_duration: 8.0

# Starting position (far away in space)
# Format: [x, y, z]
# The ship should start far behind the viewer, moving in the same direction as stars
# Positive Z = towards camera, Negative Z = away from camera
start_position: [0, 50, -8000]

# Ending position (near the lounge window)
# Format: [x, y, z]
# This is where the ship will stop and park
end_position: [-100, 30, -400]

# Notes:
# - The ship moves from start_position to end_position over approach_duration seconds
# - The animation uses ease-out cubic interpolation for smooth deceleration
# - Starfield speed decreases proportionally as ship approaches (1.0 to 0.0)
# - Y axis: positive is up, negative is down
# - Z axis: negative is away from camera (into screen), positive is toward camera (out of screen)
# - X axis: negative is left, positive is right
