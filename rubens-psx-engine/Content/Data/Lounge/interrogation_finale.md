# INTERROGATION FINALE: THE ACCUSATION
## Final Deduction Sequence

---

## OVERVIEW

After gathering evidence and interrogating suspects, the player must present their final accusation to the Telirian delegation. The finale is a streamlined 4-question system that tests whether the player has correctly deduced:

1. **WHO** killed the Ambassador (primary killer)
2. **WHO** helped them (accomplice)
3. **HOW** they executed the murder (method)
4. **WHY** they did it (true motivation)

**Stakes:**
- All correct answers: Peace treaty proceeds, war averted, billions of lives saved
- Any wrong answer: Immediate failure, diplomatic breakdown, 14 billion lives lost

**Key Rule:** Any single wrong answer results in immediate failure. This is an all-or-nothing test of your detective work.

## SUCCESS EPILOGUE

**Scene:** The Telirian delegation accepts your findings.

**Telirian Commander orders Von and Thorne brought to the Observatory Lounge.**

### Commander Sylara Von's Response:

> *Von enters in restraints, her expression serene, almost proud.*
>
> "You are correct, Detective. I killed Ambassador Lorath. But not out of hate—out of LOVE. Love for my people. Love for our warrior spirit that this 'peace' would have extinguished."
>
> "The Ambassador was a coward. He would have sold our proud military tradition for human comfort and Federation weakness. I freed him from his own betrayal. In death, he serves Telirian honor better than he ever did in life."
>
> "And yes, I took 'personal leave.' To perform my ACTUAL duty—protecting Telirian civilization from the rot of peacetime."
>
> *She looks at the Telirian Commander.*
>
> "You may execute me. But you know I'm right. This treaty will destroy us."

### Dr. Lyssa Thorne's Response:

> *Thorne enters shaking, tears streaming.*
>
> "I didn't want to! I DIDN'T WANT TO! But he was going to destroy everything! Twenty years of research! My life's work proving we could coexist! And he was going to tell the Federation we were 'culturally incompatible'!"
>
> "I just—I just needed him to not publish that report. Sylara said we could make it look like an accident, like a Fregoilli attack, and the treaty would still go through and my research would be validated and—"
>
> *Breaks down sobbing.*
>
> "I'm a scientist, not a murderer! I didn't mean for it to—I thought we were just—oh God, what have I done?"

### Telirian Commander's Judgment:

> "You have correctly identified Commander Sylara Von and Dr. Lyssa Thorne as the conspirators behind Ambassador Lorath's murder."
>
> "The Telirian delegation accepts your findings."
>
> "The peace treaty will proceed. War has been averted."
>
> "Billions of lives have been saved because of your deductive work."
