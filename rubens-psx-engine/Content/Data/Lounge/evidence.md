## THE MURDER SCENE

**Location:** Ambassador Velrun Tesh's quarters, Deck 7, Section 12

**What Investigators Find:**

- Ambassador Tesh collapsed near his bed, diplomatic robes disheveled

- His personal PADD shows his last meeting was scheduled for 2100 hours with "T.B." in his calendar
- A half-empty glass of Telirian ceremonial wine on the nightstand
- His diplomatic security lockbox is open (requires biometric + code)
- Traces of breturium particles detected only after the pathologist's deep scan
- Time of death: approximately 0300 hours
- The door logs show 4 entry codes used that night: his own, one override code, and two diplomatic access codes

## THE OBSERVATORY LOUNGE (Your Interrogation Space Bar)

A sweeping window view of streaming stars. Ambient lighting shifts from blue to purple. The bar itself is a sleek chrome curve with bioluminescent bottles. Several intimate tables with privacy fields available for interviews.

### BARTENDER: ZIX (They/Them - Andorian/Human hybrid)

**Opening Dialogue:**

Zix polishes a glass with six fingers, their antennae twitching nervously.

*"Welcome to the Observatory, Detective. Worst night of my career, and I once served drinks during a Klingon bachelor party."* 

They gesture to the tables. *"Pick your poison—er, interrogation spot. You've got six hours before the Telirians turn this ship into cosmic debris.*

*A few tips from someone who's poured drinks for every suspect on this manifest:*

- **Start with Doc Kerrigan**—he's mandatory anyway, and he's got the medical facts. He's at Table 3, probably already on his second coffee.
- **Watch for tells:** People lie differently. Some get chatty, others clam up. Trust your gut, but more importantly, trust the evidence.
- **Don't waste time:** Every suspect has dirt, but not all dirt is relevant dirt. Ask smart questions. I've seen investigators burn an hour asking about someone's favorite holonovel when they should've been asking about access codes.
- **The credibility system is brutal:** Call someone a liar when they're telling the truth? You lose standing. Eventually people just stop taking you seriously. Choose your moments.

Zix leans in conspiratorially.

*"I'll be here if you need a hint. I hear things. People forget bartenders have ears. Sometimes I'll drop by your table if I remember something useful.*

*Oh, and Detective? Someone on this ship is a very good liar. The breturium alone costs more than I make in five years. This wasn't some crime of passion. This was planned.*

*Now go. The clock's ticking, and I've got six hours worth of Telirian warships anxiety to drink through."*

## THE NINE SUSPECTS

### 1. DR. HARMON KERRIGAN (Human, Male, 50s) - The Pathologist [MANDATORY FIRST INTERVIEW]

**Role:** Chief Medical Officer

**Personality:** Exhausted, sardonic, speaks in clinical detachment with dark humor

**Public Story:** Performed the autopsy, discovered the breturium injection

**Secret Complication:** He has a gambling problem and owes money to several crew members. He's been selling "exotic medical samples" on the black market to pay debts.

**Evidence He Provides:**
- Time of death window
- Breturium injection technique (requires medical knowledge)
- Ambassador had trace amounts of sedative in his system
- The injection site suggests right-handed attacker, close personal range

**Sample Dialogue:**

*"Breturium shards? In an injection? That's not murder, Detective, that's a statement. Whoever did this wanted it personal, painful, and invisible to scanners. They also had to know Telirian physiology—breturium reacts with their copper-based blood in a way that's... let's say 'cascading organ failure' doesn't quite cover it."*

---

### 2. COMMANDER SYLARA VON (Telirian, Female, 40s)

**Role:** Ambassador Tesh's head of security

**Personality:** Intense, loyal to a fault, coiled energy barely contained

**Public Story:** She was off-duty during the murder, claims she was in the gym

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** She was in love with the Ambassador but he was arranged-married to her sister. She wanted to kill him to "free him from the loveless marriage" so they could "be together in the next life" per Telirian spiritual belief. Also, she's embezzling from his security budget to fund her underground Telirian romance novel publishing empire.

**Key Evidence:** She has diplomatic access codes. Her sister is on the ship. She has "advanced combat medicine" training.

---

### 3. LIEUTENANT MARCUS WEBB (Human, Male, 30s)

**Role:** Tactical Officer

**Personality:** Ambitious, charming, slightly too confident

**Public Story:** Was on bridge duty during the murder

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** He's actually a deep-cover Fregoilli sympathizer who supports the peace treaty, but he staged the murder to frame someone else and "unite the Federation against a common scapegoat" thereby ensuring peace through shared outrage. The plan made sense in his head. He also believes he's destined to be Captain and this would be his "hero moment."

**Key Evidence:** Has security override codes. Was alone on night bridge shift. Has requisitioned "exotic materials" for "tactical research."

---

### 4. DR. LYSSA THORNE (Human, Female, 40s)

**Role:** Xenobiologist & Research Liaison

**Personality:** Awkward, over-explains everything, nervous laugher

**Public Story:** She was studying Telirian biochemistry for the peace talks

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** She discovered the Ambassador was going to recommend against peace because he found human culture "offensively boring." This would've destroyed her life's work proving Telirians and humans are biologically compatible. She killed him so she could write the "definitive tragic romance" of his death, publish it, and finally get tenure. She's been ghost-writing Sylara's romance novels.

**Key Evidence:** Has diplomatic access. Knows Telirian physiology intimately. Her quarters are next to the Ambassador's.

---

### 5. ENSIGN TORK (Fregoilli, Male, 20s)

**Role:** Junior Engineer

**Personality:** Young, nervous, speaks too fast, sweats visibly

**Public Story:** Was working late in Engineering

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** The Fregoilli Collective ordered him to protect the Ambassador because peace is vital to his species' survival. But he's also in a secret relationship with Commander Von's sister. He tried to "fake" the Ambassador's death with a temporary toxin to evacuate him to safety, but he mixed up his chemicals and used actual breturium. He's been lying to cover up his catastrophic incompetence.

**Key Evidence:** Has engineering access to exotic materials. His requisition logs show "unspecified mineral compounds." He was logged in Engineering but no one visually saw him.

---

### 6. MAVEN KILROTH (Telirian, Male, 60s)

**Role:** Trade Negotiator (civilian)

**Personality:** Smooth, corporate, everything's a transaction

**Public Story:** He was in talks with the Ambassador about trade routes

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** The peace treaty would open trade routes that would make him personally wealthy... but the Ambassador was about to expose that Kilroth has been smuggling breturium and selling it to both sides of the conflict to fund his secret passion: competitive zero-G ballroom dancing. He killed the Ambassador with his own smuggled product to silence him, then planned to frame the Fregoilli.

**Key Evidence:** Has breturium access. Was seen arguing with the Ambassador. Has diplomatic codes from his civilian liaison status.

---

### 7. CHIEF PETTY OFFICER RAINA SOLIS (Human, Female, 35s)

**Role:** Head of Ship Security/Master-at-Arms

**Personality:** By-the-book, stern, doesn't suffer fools

**Public Story:** She was coordinating overnight security sweeps

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** She's been investigating Maven Kilroth's smuggling operation for months. She discovered he was meeting the Ambassador that night, broke into the Ambassador's room using an override code to plant surveillance devices, but accidentally left the lockbox open. She's terrified she'll be blamed and has been covering her tracks, making her look guilty.

**Key Evidence:** Has universal override codes. Security logs show she accessed that deck. She has no alibi.

---

### 8. T'VORA (Kulluran, Female, 120s)

**Role:** Federation Diplomatic Attaché

**Personality:** Logical, precise, subtly condescending

**Public Story:** She was meditating in her quarters during the murder

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** She is actually an undercover Kulluran intelligence operative monitoring illegal breturium trade. She knew about the murder in advance but let it happen because "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"—stopping the breturium network was more important than one ambassador. She didn't kill him but has been manipulating the investigation to protect her operation. She's been leaving cryptic clues to the real killer.

**Key Evidence:** She has access to everything. Her intelligence network means she knows things she shouldn't. She's too calm.

---

### 9. "LUCKY" CHEN (Human, Male, 50s)

**Role:** Ship's Quartermaster & Supply Officer

**Personality:** Jovial, wheeler-dealer, knows everyone's business

**Public Story:** He was doing inventory in Cargo Bay 3

**Comically Convoluted Motivation:** He's Dr. Kerrigan's bookie and breturium fence. He supplied the breturium that killed the Ambassador (unknowingly) through his black market side business. He's been trying to figure out who he sold it to while also covering up his involvement. He's innocent of murder but guilty of basically everything else. He's also been selling "authentic Earth antiques" that are actually replicated fakes.

**Key Evidence:** Supply manifests show exotic material orders. He's connected to multiple suspects financially. His cargo bay records have "gaps."

---

## THE ACTUAL SOLUTION (Hidden from Players)

**The Killer(s):** Commander Sylara Von (primary) and Dr. Lyssa Thorne (accomplice)

**The Method:**

1. Lyssa obtained breturium from Lucky Chen (through Kerrigan's network, unknowingly)
2. Sylara used her diplomatic access code and security knowledge to enter at 0200 hours
3. Lyssa sedated the Ambassador's ceremonial wine earlier that evening during a "cultural consultation"
4. Sylara injected him while he was sedated, using medical techniques learned from cross-training
5. They opened his lockbox together using Sylara's knowledge of his personal codes (gained through intimacy) to plant false evidence pointing to Fregoilli involvement
6. The "T.B." meeting was "Thorne - Briefing"

**Motivation:** Twisted love + academic ambition + desire to frame Fregoilli to reignite conflict (Sylara's real motivation—she's a secret warmonger who opposed the treaty)

**Red Herrings:**
- Maven Kilroth's smuggling (real but unrelated)
- Ensign Tork's bungled protection attempt (he tried the night before)
- Lt. Webb's weird political theater plan (all talk, no action)
- Chief Solis's surveillance op (made her look guilty)
- T'Vora's intelligence operation (real, but she's not the killer)

## INTERROGATION MECHANICS

### The Credibility System

- You start with **5 Credibility Points**
- When you accuse someone of lying (pressing them):
  - **If they're lying:** They may crack and reveal truth, you keep credibility
  - **If they're telling the truth:** You lose 1 credibility point
- **At 0 credibility:** Suspects refuse to cooperate further, investigation severely hampered

### Time Management

- **6 hours total = 360 minutes**
- Each suspect interview base: **30 minutes**
- Each question: **2-5 minutes** depending on complexity
  - Relevant, evidence-based questions: **2 minutes**
  - Vague or irrelevant questions: **5 minutes**
- You can revisit suspects but each return visit costs **15 minutes** "travel time"

### The Mind Map/Notebook

Players can:
- Tag evidence as: **Critical / Relevant / Suspicious / Irrelevant / Red Herring**
- Draw connections between suspects (visual web)
- Flag contradictions between testimonies
- Mark alibis as **"Verified," "Unverified,"** or **"Suspicious"**
- Note access to: **Breturium / Medical knowledge / Security codes / Motive**

### Questioning Strategy

**Good Questions (yield useful info):**
- "Where were you between 0200-0400?"
- "Who has access to the Ambassador's quarters?"
- "What's your connection to [specific evidence]?"
- "Can anyone verify your alibi?"
- "How would someone obtain breturium on this ship?"

**Waste-of-Time Questions:**
- "Do you like the Ambassador?"
- "What's your favorite food?"
- "Tell me about your childhood"
- General rambling without evidence backing

### Zix's Hints (Triggered at intervals)

- **2 hours in:** *"The shipment logs are public record. Maybe check who handles exotic materials?"*
- **3 hours in:** *"I served two people wine that night. Ambassador... and Dr. Thorne. She seemed nervous."*
- **4 hours in:** *"You know Commander Von took 'emergency personal leave' from her own security post that night? Who does that?"*
- **5 hours in:** *"Lucky Chen's been sweating more than usual. Might want to squeeze him about who he sells to."*

---

## EPILOGUE VARIATIONS

### Perfect Victory

*"The Telirians stand down. Commander Von is taken into custody, screaming poetry about eternal love. Dr. Thorne's romance novel manuscript is confiscated as evidence. Zix pours you a drink. 'Nicely done, Detective. The Ambassador's family sends their gratitude. The Federation sends a promotion. And I send... this bottle of 2247 Saurian brandy. You earned it.'"*

### Good Solve

*"Justice is served, if imperfectly. The Telirians accept your findings but express 'concerns' about Federation security. The peace treaty proceeds under heavy scrutiny. Zix gives you a tired smile. 'Could've been worse. Could've been war.'"*

### Partial Solve

*"You caught someone, but the Telirians aren't convinced you got everyone. The treaty is postponed indefinitely. Starfleet Command is... disappointed. Zix slides you a sympathy drink. 'Better luck next time, Detective. If there is a next time.'"*

### Failure

*"The Telirians withdraw from negotiations. Diplomatic relations collapse. Commander Von watches from the brig as her plan succeeds through your failure. Zix pours herself a drink. 'I'll be here when you want to try again, Detective. The simulation's still running. Learn from your mistakes.'"*

## EVIDENCE IN AMBASSADOR TESH'S QUARTERS - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### EVIDENCE ITEM #1: THE OPEN DIPLOMATIC LOCKBOX

**Description:** A secure container requiring both biometric scan AND 6-digit code. It's been opened but not forced. Contents include treaty documents, personal correspondence, and encrypted data chips.

**Why It Matters:** Only someone with intimate knowledge of the Ambassador could open this without triggering alarms.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"As head of security, who besides the Ambassador had access codes to his personal lockbox?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll claim only the Ambassador had the code, but her hesitation reveals she knew it too (intimate relationship)
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Her body language contradicts her words

**2. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"Did the Ambassador ever discuss his security protocols during your cultural consultations?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll get nervous and over-explain, possibly revealing she was present when he accessed it
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes (she rambles)
- **Potential reveal:** She mentions being in his quarters "for work" multiple times

**3. To Chief Petty Officer Raina Solis:** *"Your override codes can open diplomatic lockboxes, correct? Were any used that night?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll admit she accessed the deck but deny entering the room—half-truth that costs her credibility
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She's hiding something but may not be the killer

**4. To T'Vora:** *"From a security standpoint, how many people on this ship could bypass a Telirian diplomatic lockbox?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** Her Kulluran precision will narrow the suspect list and she'll mention "biometric override requires either medical database access or personal knowledge"
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Points toward someone with both security clearance AND intimate connection

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Start with T'Vora (narrows technical suspects), then press Sylara Von (she's the killer and will show tells).

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #2: HALF-EMPTY GLASS OF TELIRIAN CEREMONIAL WINE

**Description:** Traditional Telirian vintage served in a ceremonial chalice. Toxicology shows trace amounts of a mild sedative (not lethal, but enough to make someone drowsy).

**Why It Matters:** Someone with knowledge of Telirian customs prepared this drink, and it was used to incapacitate the Ambassador before injection.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Dr. Harmon Kerrigan:** *"The sedative in the wine—what's its origin? Medical supply or something else?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll identify it as a common sleep aid from the medbay, suggesting someone with medical access
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Multiple people have access, but he'll mention "cross-training programs"

**2. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"Telirian ceremonial wine—you're the cultural expert. Who would know how to properly prepare and serve it?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll get defensive and over-explain her expertise, revealing she personally prepared wine for the Ambassador before
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes (nervous rambling)
- **Potential reveal:** She admits being in his quarters that evening for a "cultural briefing"

**3. To Zix (The Bartender):** *"Did anyone order or discuss Telirian ceremonial wine recently?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** Zix will remember Dr. Thorne asking about proper serving temperature and rituals two days before
- **Time cost:** 1 minute (Zix is efficient)
- **Potential reveal:** Direct connection between Thorne and the wine

**4. To Maven Kilroth:** *"As a trade negotiator, you'd know Telirian customs. What does serving ceremonial wine signify?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll explain it's reserved for intimate gatherings or significant personal moments—not standard diplomatic meetings
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** The wine suggests a personal, not professional, context

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Zix first (quick confirmation of Thorne connection), then press Dr. Thorne directly (she's the accomplice).

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #3: PERSONAL PADD WITH "T.B." MEETING AT 2100 HOURS

**Description:** The Ambassador's personal schedule device shows a meeting logged as "T.B. - 2100 hours - Personal Quarters." No other details.

**Why It Matters:** This identifies who had legitimate access to his quarters that evening and establishes timeline.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"The Ambassador's calendar shows a meeting with 'T.B.' at 2100 hours. Were you meeting with him that night?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** Her initials match. She'll admit the meeting ("Thorne - Briefing") but claim it was brief and professional
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She was there but will lie about duration and purpose

**2. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"Did the Ambassador have any scheduled meetings you were aware of the night he died?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll claim no knowledge, showing she wasn't informed—unusual for head of security unless it was deliberately hidden
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Her lack of knowledge about T.B. suggests the Ambassador kept secrets from her (motive for jealous rage)

**3. To Chief Petty Officer Raina Solis:** *"Security logs—can you tell me everyone who accessed the Ambassador's deck between 2000 and 0400 hours?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll provide access logs showing Thorne (2100), Sylara (0200), and her own entry (2330)
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Timeline evidence that places both killers at the scene

**4. To Lieutenant Marcus Webb:** *"You were on bridge duty. Did anyone request information about the Ambassador's schedule that night?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll mention Commander Von asked about the Ambassador's meetings around 2200 hours
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Von was tracking the Ambassador's activities that night

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Chief Solis first (objective data), then confront Thorne with the timeline, then press Von about her inquiries.

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #4: SCORCH MARKS ON NECK (INJECTION SITE)

**Description:** Small, precise burn marks where the breturium injection entered. The injection angle and precision suggest medical training and right-handed attacker at close range.

**Why It Matters:** Narrows suspects to those with medical knowledge and opportunity for intimate-range attack.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Dr. Harmon Kerrigan:** *"The injection technique—how many people on this ship could perform it this precisely?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll list medical staff, but also mention "security personnel with combat medicine certification"
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Commander Von has advanced medical cross-training

**2. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"Your service record shows combat medic certification. Have you ever administered injections in the field?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll confirm her training, inadvertently placing herself as capable of the method
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She's skilled enough to do this and right-handed

**3. To Ensign Tork:** *"As an engineer, do you have any medical training? The injection shows technical precision."*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll panic and over-explain his "basic first aid" training, revealing his botched attempt the night BEFORE
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes (nervous confession)
- **Potential reveal:** Red herring—he tried something similar previously but failed

**4. To T'Vora:** *"Kulluran analysis: What does the injection precision tell us about the killer's state of mind?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll note "controlled, calculated, emotionally steady during execution—contradicting crime of passion"
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** This was premeditated, not impulsive

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Dr. Kerrigan first (establishes who's capable), then press Commander Von directly (she has means and training).

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #5: FOUR DOOR ACCESS CODES LOGGED

**Description:** Security logs show four separate access codes used on the Ambassador's door that night:
- 2045 hours: Ambassador's personal code (returning to quarters)
- 2100 hours: Diplomatic access code #1
- 0200 hours: Diplomatic access code #2
- 0230 hours: Security override code

**Why It Matters:** Creates timeline and identifies who had physical access to the crime scene.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Chief Petty Officer Raina Solis:** *"I need to know who these access codes belong to. Can you trace diplomatic codes #1 and #2?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll reveal Code #1 = Dr. Thorne (xenobiologist), Code #2 = Commander Von (security detail)
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Both killers accessed the room at different times

**2. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"Your diplomatic access code was used at 0200 hours. Where were you?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll claim she was checking on security after hours—suspicious timing
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She's lying about her gym alibi

**3. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"Your access code was used at 2100—that matches your meeting time. How long did you stay?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll claim "20 minutes, just a briefing," but door logs show no exit code until 2245—she was there over an hour
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Plenty of time to sedate the wine

**4. To Chief Petty Officer Raina Solis:** *"The security override at 0230—that's your code. Why did you access the Ambassador's quarters?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll admit she was planting surveillance devices to catch Maven Kilroth's smuggling meet
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes (defensive explanation)
- **Potential reveal:** She saw the lockbox already open, making her look guilty but she's actually innocent

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Solis first (get the code assignments), then confront both Thorne and Von with the timeline discrepancies.

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #6: BRETURIUM PARTICLE TRACES

**Description:** Exotic radioactive mineral fragments detected only after deep pathological scan. Extremely rare, expensive, and highly controlled. Reacts violently with Telirian copper-based blood, causing cascading organ failure.

**Why It Matters:** Only a few people on the ship could access this material—it's the smoking gun for means.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To "Lucky" Chen:** *"Supply manifests show exotic materials orders. Has anyone requisitioned breturium or radioactive minerals recently?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll get nervous and admit he "sources specialty items" for various crew, including Dr. Kerrigan
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Connection between black market breturium and multiple suspects

**2. To Maven Kilroth:** *"As a trade negotiator, you'd know the breturium market. How would someone acquire it on this ship?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll deflect but reveal too much knowledge about smuggling routes—suspicious
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** He's the original source, but sold it unknowingly to the killer

**3. To Lieutenant Marcus Webb:** *"Your tactical research requisitions show 'exotic materials'—was breturium among them?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll admit requisitioning small amounts for weapons testing, but logs show he never picked up his order
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Red herring—he had access but didn't use it

**4. To Dr. Harmon Kerrigan:** *"How would a medical professional get their hands on breturium? Your gambling debts might motivate creative acquisition."*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll defensively admit buying from Lucky Chen but claim he sold it to "anonymous buyers" through dead drops
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes (he's rattled)
- **Potential reveal:** Chain of custody: Kilroth → Lucky → Kerrigan → Unknown buyer (actually Thorne)

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Lucky Chen first (establishes supply chain), then Kerrigan (reveals he was the fence), then trace who bought from Kerrigan.

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #7: AMBASSADOR'S DISHEVELED DIPLOMATIC ROBES

**Description:** The Ambassador's formal robes are twisted and partially removed, suggesting a struggle or intimate encounter. Telirian diplomatic robes are complex garments that require assistance or familiarity to remove.

**Why It Matters:** Indicates the killer had physical proximity and possibly intimate knowledge of Telirian customs/dress.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"Telirian diplomatic robes—you've studied the cultural significance. Would the Ambassador have removed them himself for a business meeting?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll explain they're only removed for meditation, sleep, or intimate situations—not meetings
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** The scene suggests intimacy, not business

**2. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"The robes were disheveled. As someone who knew the Ambassador personally, what would cause that?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll show emotional reaction, possibly revealing the intimate nature of their relationship
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Her grief seems personal, not professional

**3. To Maven Kilroth:** *"In your business dealings with the Ambassador, did he ever receive you in informal dress?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll say absolutely not—Telirian diplomats maintain formality
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Whoever was there had a personal, not business, relationship

**4. To T'Vora:** *"The state of the body suggests what kind of relationship between victim and killer?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll logically deduce "proximity, trust, possibly romantic or familial connection"
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Narrows to suspects with intimate access

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Dr. Thorne first (cultural context), then use the information to press Commander Von about her relationship with the victim.

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #8: ENCRYPTED DATA CHIPS IN THE LOCKBOX

**Description:** Three data chips marked with Telirian military encryption. Contents require specialized decryption but headers suggest they contain: peace treaty drafts, personal correspondence, and financial records.

**Why It Matters:** Motive—what was worth killing for? Could reveal blackmail, financial crimes, or political secrets.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To T'Vora:** *"Your intelligence background—can you decrypt these Telirian military chips?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll reluctantly decrypt them, revealing the Ambassador planned to oppose the treaty due to "cultural incompatibility" findings
- **Time cost:** 5 minutes (decryption process)
- **Potential reveal:** Dr. Thorne's motive—her life's work would be destroyed

**2. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"These chips contain the Ambassador's final assessment of human-Telirian cultural compatibility. He was going to reject the treaty. Did you know?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll crack under pressure, revealing she discovered this and it would've ruined her academic career
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Strong motive for murder

**3. To Maven Kilroth:** *"The financial records show substantial payments to an off-world account. Yours?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll lawyer up immediately, confirming his smuggling operation but denying murder
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** His motive is real but he might not be the killer

**4. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"Did the Ambassador discuss his final treaty recommendation with you?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll reveal he told her he was supporting the treaty—contradiction with the files
- **Time cost:** 2 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** He lied to her, or the files were altered

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** T'Vora first (decrypt the data), then confront Dr. Thorne with her destroyed career motive, then question Von about her knowledge.

---

### EVIDENCE ITEM #9: TRACE SKIN CELLS UNDER AMBASSADOR'S FINGERNAILS

**Description:** Forensic analysis reveals skin cells that don't match the Ambassador—suggesting he scratched his attacker during a brief struggle or intimate contact.

**Why It Matters:** DNA evidence that can definitively place someone in physical contact with the victim at time of death.

#### Four Key Questions:

**1. To Dr. Harmon Kerrigan:** *"The DNA under his nails—can you match it to crew records?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** He'll run the analysis and identify two DNA profiles: majority Commander Von, trace amounts Dr. Thorne
- **Time cost:** 5 minutes (lab work)
- **Potential reveal:** Physical evidence of both killers

**2. To Commander Sylara Von:** *"Your DNA was found under the Ambassador's fingernails. Explain."*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll claim they had a physical relationship and casual contact was normal—but she can't explain the timing
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She admits intimate relationship but denies being there at time of death (lie)

**3. To Dr. Lyssa Thorne:** *"Trace amounts of your DNA were also found. How did it get there?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll panic and claim contamination from earlier cultural consultations
- **Time cost:** 4 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** She's desperate and her story doesn't hold up

**4. To Chief Petty Officer Raina Solis:** *"DNA evidence places two specific people in physical contact with the victim. Would you like to revise your statement about who accessed that room?"*
- **Why this advances plot:** She'll confirm she saw signs of multiple people when she planted her surveillance device
- **Time cost:** 3 minutes
- **Potential reveal:** Corroborating evidence of conspiracy

**BEST QUESTION TO ASK:** Dr. Kerrigan first (get the DNA results), then confront both Von and Thorne with the physical evidence—this is your smoking gun.

## OPTIMAL INVESTIGATION PATH

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering (60 minutes)
1. **Dr. Kerrigan** (mandatory) - Get autopsy details, DNA analysis
2. **Chief Solis** - Get access logs and code assignments
3. **Zix** - Quick question about wine service
4. **T'Vora** - Decrypt data chips

### Phase 2: Narrowing Suspects (90 minutes)
5. **Lucky Chen** - Trace breturium supply chain
6. **Maven Kilroth** - Confirm smuggling (red herring)
7. **Lt. Webb** - Eliminate as suspect (red herring)
8. **Ensign Tork** - Confirm his botched attempt (red herring)

### Phase 3: Closing the Net (120 minutes)
9. **Dr. Thorne** - Confront with wine, DNA, motive from data chips
10. **Commander Von** - Confront with DNA, access codes, medical training
11. **Return to Solis** - Confirm she saw evidence of conspiracy
12. **Final confrontation** with both killers together

**Total Time:** 4.5 hours  
**Credibility:** 4-5 points retained (minimal false accusations)  
**Result:** Perfect solve with both killers identified

## GAME MASTER NOTES

- Players should feel the time pressure without being rushed
- Zix can provide hints if players are stuck, but shouldn't give away the solution
- The red herrings should be compelling enough to waste time if players don't follow evidence carefully
- Credibility loss should sting but not make the game unwinnable
- The convoluted motivations add humor while the core mystery remains solvable through evidence
- DNA evidence and access logs are the "smoking guns" that crack the case
- The accomplice twist makes this harder than a single-killer mystery
- Encourage players to take notes and draw connection webs

**Victory depends on:** Evidence-based reasoning, time management, credibility preservation, and recognizing that two suspects working together explain contradictions better than one.
