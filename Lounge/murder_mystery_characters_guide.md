**Key Evidence He Provides:**
- Time of death window
- Breturium injection requires medical knowledge
- Sedative traces in Ambassador's system
- Right-handed attacker, close range

**Sample Opening Dialogue:**
> "Breturium shards? In an injection? That's not murder, Detective, that's a statement. Whoever did this wanted it personal, painful, and invisible to scanners. They also had to know Telirian physiology—breturium reacts with their copper-based blood in a way that's... let's say 'cascading organ failure' doesn't quite cover it."

**Possible Questions:**
- "Walk me through the autopsy findings."
- "Who has the medical knowledge to perform this injection?"
- "How would someone obtain breturium on this ship?"

- **Start:** 5 Credibility Points
- **Accuse truth-teller of lying:** -1 Credibility
- **At 0 Credibility:** Suspects refuse cooperation

- **Total Time:** 6 hours (360 minutes)
- **Base Interview:** 30 minutes per suspect
- **Good Questions:** 2 minutes
- **Poor Questions:** 5 minutes
- **Return Visits:** 15 minutes travel time

## ZIX'S HINTS (TIMED)

**2 Hours In:**
> "The shipment logs are public record. Maybe check who handles exotic materials?"

**3 Hours In:**
> "I served two people wine that night. Ambassador... and Dr. Thorne. She seemed nervous."

**4 Hours In:**
> "You know Commander Von took 'emergency personal leave' from her own security post that night? Who does that?"

**5 Hours In:**
> "Lucky Chen's been sweating more than usual. Might want to squeeze him about who he sells to."

---

## THE SOLUTION

### THE KILLERS
**Primary:** Commander Sylara Von  
**Accomplice:** Dr. Lyssa Thorne

### THE METHOD
1. Thorne obtained breturium from Lucky Chen (via Kerrigan's network)
2. Thorne sedated the Ambassador's wine during evening "cultural consultation"
3. Sylara used diplomatic access code to enter at 0200 hours
4. Sylara injected sedated Ambassador using medical combat training
5. Together they opened lockbox using Sylara's knowledge of his codes
6. Planted false evidence pointing to Fregoilli

### THE MOTIVE
- **Sylara:** Twisted love + secret warmonger opposing treaty
- **Thorne:** Academic ambition + destroying evidence of Ambassador's opposition to her work

### KEY EVIDENCE CONNECTIONS
- "T.B." = "Thorne - Briefing"
- Wine sedative = Thorne's access
- Injection technique = Sylara's combat medicine
- Diplomatic codes = Sylara's security clearance
- Breturium source = Chen → Kerrigan → Thorne
- Lockbox access = Sylara's intimate knowledge

---

## RED HERRINGS

1. **Maven Kilroth** - Really is smuggling, didn't kill anyone
2. **Lieutenant Webb** - Planned theater, no execution
3. **Ensign Tork** - Bungled protection attempt night before
4. **Chief Solis** - Surveillance op made her look guilty
5. **T'Vora** - Intelligence operation, not murder
6. **Lucky Chen** - Black market fence, unknowing supplier
7. **Dr. Kerrigan** - Gambling debts and shady deals, not murder

- **Webb:** Gets smoother, more charming, appeals to authority
- **Tork:** Speaks faster, more contradictions, sweats
- **Kilroth:** Gets transactional, offers deals, changes subject

---

## EPILOGUE VARIATIONS

### PERFECT VICTORY
> "The Telirians stand down. Commander Von is taken into custody, screaming poetry about eternal love. Dr. Thorne's romance novel manuscript is confiscated as evidence. Zix pours you a drink. 'Nicely done, Detective. The Ambassador's family sends their gratitude. The Federation sends a promotion. And I send... this bottle of 2247 Saurian brandy. You earned it.'"

### GOOD SOLVE
> "Justice is served, if imperfectly. The Telirians accept your findings but express 'concerns' about Federation security. The peace treaty proceeds under heavy scrutiny. Zix gives you a tired smile. 'Could've been worse. Could've been war.'"

### PARTIAL SOLVE
> "You caught someone, but the Telirians aren't convinced you got everyone. The treaty is postponed indefinitely. Starfleet Command is... disappointed. Zix slides you a sympathy drink. 'Better luck next time, Detective. If there is a next time.'"

### FAILURE
> "The Telirians withdraw from negotiations. Diplomatic relations collapse. Commander Von watches from the brig as her plan succeeds through your failure. Zix pours herself a drink. 'I'll be here when you want to try again, Detective. The simulation's still running. Learn from your mistakes.'"

## INVESTIGATION TIPS

1. **Start with Kerrigan** (mandatory) - establishes medical facts
2. **Track access** - Who has codes? Medical knowledge? Breturium access?
3. **Verify alibis** - Cross-reference testimonies
4. **Follow the breturium** - Chen → Kerrigan → ? → Murder weapon
5. **Watch for connections** - Thorne's wine, Sylara's leave, "T.B." meeting
6. **Don't waste time on red herrings** - Real crimes ≠ This murder
7. **Use evidence to press** - Accusations without proof waste credibility
8. **Mind the clock** - Every minute counts
